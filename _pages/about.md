My name is Xian Fu. Now Iâ€™m a 3rd year MS student of the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html). Before that, I got my Bachelor Degree from Jilin University, Tang Aoqing Honors Program (Computer Science) at 2022.

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning, MLLMs/LLMs for Robotics, and so on.
